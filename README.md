# Melanoma Classification

## Group members
Nathan Gyger, Léonard Barras

## Goal
Implement a deep learning algorithm to classify mole pictures as benign or malignant using the [ISIC database](https://isic-archive.com/).

## Project desciption
This is a group project for the master’s module _Advanced Topics in Machine Learning_. In the context of this project, we want to partly participate in task three of the ISIC challenge ([ISIC Task 3](https://challenge2018.isic-archive.com/task3/)).
The ISIC database contains roughly 23000 dermoscopic images. Most of which have associated clinical metadata including morphological segmentation masks and skin tumor classifications. However, the main classes are represented highly unbalanced. While the dataset includes 19373 benign samples, the numbers of malignant (2286 samples) and unknown (2228 samples) tumors are much smaller.
Therefore, the goal of our project is to tackle the supervised learning problem of classifying the data into the two classes (benign/ malignant). While especially focusing on the problem of class unbalance.

## Project challenges
Work with class imabalance and limited dataset size.
